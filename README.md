# SyncSavedWindows
---

Sync saved windows. Inspired by TabCloud (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tabcloud/).

This extension provides a toolbar button with a popup of a list of saved and opened windows. List is synchronised through Firefox Sync Account.

The reason for this extension is due to the reason that TabCloud does not support Multiprocess on Firefox (Electrolysis).
