# SyncSavedWindows

Sync saved windows. Inspired by TabCloud (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tabcloud/).

This extension provides a toolbar button with a popup of a list of saved and opened windows. List can be synchronised through Google account.

The reason for this extension is due to the reason that TabCloud does not support Firefox Quantum.
